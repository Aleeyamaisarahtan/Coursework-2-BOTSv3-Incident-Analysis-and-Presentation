# INTRODUCTION
<div align="justify">
A Security Operations Center (SOC) is the core organizational function responsible for continuously monitoring, assessing, and improving an enterprise's security posture. Its primary purpose is to prevent, detect, analyze, and respond to cybersecurity threats. SOCs rely on a combination of specialized roles, well-defined processes, and technical infrastructures—such as Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems, intrusion detection tools, and threat intelligence platforms—to enable situational awareness and incident management. The ultimate goal is to minimize organizational risk by converting raw log data into actionable intelligence on potential intrusions. From the perspective of a security analyst within a SOC, these activities involve applying systematic intrusion analysis methodologies to identify, investigate, and mitigate threats effectively.  
<br/><br/>
The Boss of the SOC (BOTSv3) dataset is a publicly available, pre-indexed security dataset and Capture The Flag (CTF) platform created by Splunk. It is designed to train and test the skills of cybersecurity professionals, students, and enthusiasts in security analysis. The platform simulates a realistic security incident within a fictitious brewing company named "Frothly," providing a massive collection of logs from network, endpoint, email, and cloud service environments such as Amazon AWS and Microsoft Azure. Users must use Splunk's Search Processing Language (SPL) to analyze the data, identify anomalies, investigate the simulated attack, and practice real-world security response techniques.

The objective of this investigation is to utilize Splunk’s SPL on the BOTSv3 data sources, primarily focusing on aws:cloudtrail, aws:s3:accesslogs, and winhostmon, to systematically identify the initial stages of a breach targeting both AWS cloud infrastructure and a key endpoint asset. The investigation begins with a reconnaissance phase, aiming to identify legitimate IAM users accessing the AWS environment and determine the specific API activity field that can be used to alert on non-MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) access, thereby highlighting a critical security weakness. Next, the investigation reconstructs a security incident involving AWS misconfiguration and potential data exfiltration. This involves identifying the event ID of the API call that publicly exposed an S3 bucket, determining the IAM user (“Bud”) responsible for the misconfiguration, and identifying the name of the S3 bucket and the text file uploaded to the publicly accessible bucket, suggesting unauthorized data staging or exfiltration. Lastly, the investigation seeks to characterize the internal environment using host monitoring data. This includes identifying the processor number used on the web servers and pinpointing the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of the endpoint running a distinct Windows operating system edition, which could indicate a unique or vulnerable target host.
